BEER-PROJECT

About the project:
This project was created for phase-1 Flatiron software engineering program. The intent is to offer a variety of beer related suggestions and entertainment.

Setup/Features:

- open index.html with your browser
- use the city form to find breweries in you local area
- use the 'buzzed' dropdown menu to get beer recommendations based on ABV
- use the 'food' dropdown menu to get food-pairing suggestions based on a food type
- discover your hidden 'hammered handle'
- discover one other hidden feature

Eventual Goals:

- currently the ABV suggestions only returns 5 items for each 'buzz type'
  (the eventual goal would make this query much larger returning different suggestions
  with each query)
- I would like to make the ABV suggestions 'clickable' so you can click on each name and find out more info including: Brewery Name, Description, Picture etc
- I would like to link the food-pairings to the ABV suggestions so they match the beer your drinking, as well as filtering the returned suggestions to be less of a 'fuzzy' match
